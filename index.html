            Social media sites save a lot of information about us and so does our account. If in case our account gets hacked, a lot of information about us is revealed to the hacker which can cause some trouble. If even or email id is revealed, the hacker can send some spam or phishing links which will be a headache. Another problem is 'bombing'. In this method of annoying, a lot of emails or sms's are sent by a person at our email id or phone number messaging app in a matter of seconds. And of course there are social creeps. The worst part of this is that, this is too easy, anybody can commit this type of thing, literally anyone. So to protect our self from this type of thing, i will tell you how to give the least information as you can to these social media sites.

            <br>
             Go to instagram.com or any other social media site where you want to create your account. <b>Make sure it starts with 'https:' </b> to confirm this is the legit site.
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
             In the name field, <b>do not write your real name</b> as it makes it easier for the hacker to find your account.

            <br>
            <br>
             This is not something new but this is compulsory, <b>enter your age above 18 years</b> or else most sites won't allow kids or teens.

            <br>
             Ok this one is pretty important, you should never give your real email ids to any website, so <b>you should use temporary mail webisites</b>. They temporarilly allot you a virtual email id in there server and all the emails such as otps will come on these which will not be publically accessible to everyone. So its safe. some recommended temp mail websites are: <a href="https://tempmail.email/">Temp Mail</a>, <a href="https://10minemail.com/">10 min email</a>, <a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10 minute email</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>6.Phone number:</b> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/social-addict-2/64/data-phishing-phone-hook-fraudulent-512.png" alt="vishing" height="200" width="200">
            <br>
            <br>
            I do not recommend using a temp mobile number service as these phone messages are publically available to everyone who visits this site. These messages may contain someone's account otp, password, email or even impoortant details of their e-commerce accounts. If you use this, anyone wll be able to login in as you in your account. <b>And dont think of visiting these sites for stealing others accounts.</b> Not because they will be in trouble but because these accounts actually never existed. These are links in order to attack any person who visits their site for "logging in to someone else's account". It can also cause vishing which is basically phishing but by using voice by calling the victim.
